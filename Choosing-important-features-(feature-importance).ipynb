    "Feature importance is the technique used to select features using a trained supervised classifier. When we train a classifier such as a decision tree, we evaluate each attribute to create splits; we can use this measure as a feature selector. Let’s understand it in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are among the most popular machine learning methods thanks to their relatively good accuracy, robustness, and ease of use. They also provide two straightforward methods for feature selection—mean decrease impurity and mean decrease accuracy."
